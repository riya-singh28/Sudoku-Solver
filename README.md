# Sudoku-Solver

This is a program which solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. This program is written completely in C++ and built wholly from scratch, it reads input either from a user or from a file containing the Sudoku values and solves the puzzle. It employs concepts such as backtracking and recursion.

**Getting Started**

Simply download the sudoku-solver.cpp file found in the Sudoku-Solver/ directory. Run it using any standard C++ compiler. In case of any errors or compatibility issues, submit an issue in this git.

Once run, the program will ask user to input the Sudoku puzzle into it. There are two options to input values into program.

The user can either input the values manually one-by-one when the program is running.

Or The user can write all the values into a file, seperated by whitespaces. The file can have any name(less than 20 letters) or extension. When the program is running, the user will be prompted to simply enter the name of the file (with extension). Below is an example of how the contents of such a file might look. Look at the sample.txt files in the same directory for more examples.
